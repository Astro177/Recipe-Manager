      "Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, cream together 1 cup of softened unsalted butter, 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, and 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 large eggs and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips. Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving enough space between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!",
